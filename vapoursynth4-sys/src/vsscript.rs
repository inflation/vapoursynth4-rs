// VSScript4.h
//! `VSScript` provides a convenient wrapper for VapourSynth’s scripting interface(s),
//! allowing the evaluation of `VapourSynth` scripts and retrieval of output clips.
//!
//! For reasons unknown, the `VSScript` library is called `VSScript` in Windows and
//! `vapoursynth-script` everywhere else.
//!
//! At this time, `VapourSynth` scripts can be written only in Python (version 3).
//!
//! Here are a few users of the `VSScript` library:
//!
//! * [vspipe](https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/blob/master/src/vspipe/vspipe.cpp)
//! * [vsvfw](https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/blob/master/src/vfw/vsvfw.cpp)
//! * [an example program][1]
//! * the video player [mpv]
//!
//! [1]: https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/blob/master/sdk/vsscript_example.c
//! [mpv]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/video/filter/vf_vapoursynth.c
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! If `libvapoursynth-script` is loaded with `dlopen()`, the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag must be used.
//! If not, Python won’t be able to import binary modules. This is due to Python’s design.
